    <h2>Features</h2>
    <p><strong>Imagine you wake up on a sunny morning, and as you stretch and get out of bed, your DailyMaily AI assistant greets you with a friendly voice:</strong></p>
    <p>“Good morning! You’ve got three unread emails waiting for you. The first is from the airline with your flight details for tomorrow. The second is a newsletter from Jamie filled with the latest industry updates. And the third is from your partner, asking about picking up the kids after school.</p>
    <p>Would you like to check in for your flight? I can handle that for you right now. Also, I can help you draft a reply to your partner about the kids. Just let me know how you’d like to proceed!”</p>
    <p>You take a moment to think. “Yes, please check me in for the flight. And I’ll need to confirm with my partner that I can pick up the kids after work.”</p>
    <p>“Got it! I’ll start the check-in process now,” the assistant replies. “And here’s a draft response for your partner: ‘Hi [Partner's Name], I’ll be able to pick up the kids after school. Just let me know if there’s anything else you need!’ Shall I send it?”</p>
    <p>You nod, and the AI confirms, “Sent! Now you’re all checked in for your flight, and your boarding pass is ready. By the way, don’t forget to pack your essentials for the trip. Would you like me to remind you later?”</p>
    <p>“Yes, that would be helpful!” you say, feeling grateful for the assistance.</p>
